            <h3>CANCELLATON POLICY </h3>
            <p>
              The Ramya Boutique believes in helping its customers as far as
              possible, and has therefore a liberal cancellation policy. Under
              this policy, cancellations will be considered only if the request
              is made within 12 hours of placing an order. Within 7-10 working
              days, you will receive a credit note for your refund. In case of
              any custom alterations has been done as per request of the
              customer, no cancellation or change is possible
            </p>

            <h3>RETURN/ EXCHANGE POLICY</h3>
            <p>
              All products are pre-checked for quality and defects before they
              are shipped. In spite of our best efforts, if you find the product
              delivered is damaged, kindly email customer care for a return
              procedure within 48 hours of delivery. The decision to accept
              returns rests solely with the The Ramya Boutique team. Once the
              products are shipped, no returns will be accepted unless the
              above-mentioned details hold true. If the customer dislikes the
              product, it is not eligible for exchange.
            </p>
            <p>
              The photos of all products are taken under neutral lighting
              conditions, and we make the best possible effort to reproduce the
              exact color. Sometimes the colors may look different due to the
              temperature of your monitor and/or device settings. Please ensure
              that products are returned in their original condition and
              packaging in order to get your full credit. Kindly note that this
              is a non-negotiable policy. Once the The Ramya Boutique team
              decides to accept the request, it shall take a week&quot;s time to
              issue a credit note or exchange. Finally, the exchange facility
              will be made available only once. Repetitive exchange requests
              will not be considered.
            </p>

            <h3>PAYMENT POLICY</h3>
            <p>
              Customers can pay through any of the cards that are accepted by
              the above gateways. Any partial or full refunds in case of
              unavailability of the product will be credited back to the
              respective accounts through which we have received payments. The
              price of the product mentioned on the website is final and we do
              not offer discounts of any nature. The Ramya Boutique is not
              responsible if any form of fraud occurs while you are making
              payments as all transactions are done on the respective payment
              gateway partner&quot;s website. However, we do promise to help in
              whatever way possible in case you are facing difficulty making
              payments. The Cash on Delivery option is currently not available
              on our website.
            </p>

            <h3>CUSTOMER ALTERATION</h3>
            <p>
              Customers are advised to check and review their measurements
              before submitting them. In case you&quot;ve forgotten to provide
              some information while placing the order, you can always write us
              an email and we will be happy to do whatever is possible. Any
              changes to measurements not communicated within 2 hours of placing
              the order will be ignored.
            </p>

            <h3>PRICING INFORMATION</h3>
            <p>
              While The Ramya Boutique strives to provide accurate product and
              pricing information, typographical errors may occur. If the
              product is listed with an incorrect price or information, The
              Ramya Boutique shall have the right, at its sole discretion, to
              refuse or cancel any orders placed for that product, unless the
              product has already been dispatched. In such a case, The Ramya
              Boutique may either contact you for instructions or cancel your
              order and notify you of such a cancellation. Unless the product
              ordered by you has been dispatched, your offer will not be deemed
              accepted and The Ramya Boutique will have the right to modify the
              price of the product and contact you for further instructions
              using the e-mail address provided by you during the time of
              registration, or cancel the order and notify you of such
              cancellation. If we accept your order, the amount will be deducted
              from your credit card account and you will be notified by email
              that the payment has been processed. The payment may be processed
              prior to The Ramya Boutique&quot;s dispatch of the product that
              you have ordered. If we have to cancel the order after we have
              processed the payment, the said amount will be reversed back to
              your credit card account. We strive to provide you with the best
              prices. However, sometimes a price online may not match the price
              in a store. In our effort to be the lowest price provider in your
              particular geographic region, store pricing may sometimes differ
              from online prices. Prices and availability are subject to change
              without notice.
