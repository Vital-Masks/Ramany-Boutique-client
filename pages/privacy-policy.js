              electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the
              information we collect online. We use data collection devices such
              as &quot;cookies&quot; on certain pages of the website to help
              analyze our web page flow, measure promotional effectiveness, and
              promote trust and safety. &quot;Cookies&quot; are small files

              provide information that is targeted to your interests. Most
              cookies are &quot;session cookies,&quot; which means that they are

              view a web page created by a user, there may be a
              &quot;cookie&quot; placed within that web page. We do not control
              the use of cookies by third parties.

            <p>
              <a href="www.theramyaboutique.com">www.theramyaboutique.com</a>{' '}
              operates a strict privacy policy and we are committed to being
              transparent about how we use cookies on our website.
            </p>

            <h4>Why are cookies important?</h4>
            <p>
              Cookies help you make your online experience more efficient and
              relevant to your interests. For instance, they are used to
              remember your preferences on sites you visit often, to remember
              your user ID and the contents of your shopping baskets, and to
              help you navigate between pages efficiently.
            </p>

            <h4>What is a Cookie?</h4>
            <p>
              A cookie is a small file, or files, on your computer, phone, or
              other device with a browser to save snippets of text for reference
              by the website you are visiting. All cookies have expiration dates
              in them that determine how long they stay in your browser:
            </p>

            <p>
              Session cookiesâ€”these are temporary cookies that expire (and are
              automatically erased) whenever you close your browser.
            </p>
            <p>
              Persistent cookies: these usually have an expiration date and so
              stay in your browser until they expire, or until you manually
              delete them. For example, we use persistent cookies to better
              understand usage patterns so that we can improve the site for our
              customers.
            </p>
            <p>Cookies are grouped into the following categories:</p>
            <p>
              Essential: these are cookies that are required for the regular
              operation of our websites.
            </p>
            <p>
              Functional: These remember your preferences and are intended to
              make your experience on our websites better for you.
            </p>
            <p>
              Analytics: these cookies are used for performance measurement to
              understand things like how many people visit our websites, how
              they navigate our sites, and what content is popular.{' '}
            </p>
            <p>
              Advertising: These cookies enable us and our advertising partners
              to serve you with relevant advertisements that we think will
              interest you. You might see these advertisements on our websites
              or on other websites you visit. These cookies record your visit to
              our website and the content you interact with. They may be placed
              by us, or by advertising partners with our permission.
            </p>
            <p>
              To ensure compliance with our policies, we restrict the use of
              third-party cookies to trusted partners.
            </p>
            <p>
              We also use third-party information from third-party sources to
              enable us to deliver advertising. These sources are validated by a
              third party and not by us.
